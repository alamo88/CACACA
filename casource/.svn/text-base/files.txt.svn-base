Log:

Makefile*  The makefile. Note that localrules is also needed to properly handle CWEB (.w) files, also
            if 'tangling' the files manually you have to strip leading spaces for #directives (my STANGLE
            script does this)
bigblock.c* Initialise the big block structures.

blocks.h*   Defines the bigblock and subblock structures.

ca_solid.c* Output of stangle ca_solid.w
ca_solid.w  The main subroutine called by ca_wrapper, calls initialisation,
            calculation, and finish routines.
            
ca_wrapper.c* Calls the ca_solid routine in solo mode. 
ca_matrix.h
colour.h*    Defines the colour table for output images.
constants.h

cube.h*      Defines the lookup table for neighbour pointers.

fcopymat.c*  Float version, copy a subblock array to/from padded space.
fcopymat.w   CWEB source for above.

fem.h*       Something to do with fininte element models.

fidap.h*     Something to do with Fidap fluid flow/heat transger models.

fidap_interp_calc.c* Calculate the temperature based on an input file.

fidap_interp_init.c* Initialise the ??
find_max.c   Contains the routine(s) for finding max values 
find_max.h   Prototype for above functions, include in files that use find_max

grain.h*    Defines the grain structure.

icopymat.c* integer version - copy subblock array to/from padded space.
icopymat.w  Cweb source for above.

init_sb_neigh.c* Initialise the neighbour pointers for subblocks.

initcube.c*  Initialise the lookup table for neighbours.
initface.c*  Initialise the face-code for neigbhours of subblock faces.
localrules   Required by Makefile, includes def. for clean and wfiles

machine.h*   Initialise machine dependant things, also some constants still in here.

matprops.h*  Set up the mprops structure.

nbhd.h*      Define the neighbourhood structures.

nbhd_def.c*  Define the allowed neighbourhoods.

nucprops.h*  Define the nucleation props sturcture

oriented.inc* Section to handle oriented grains.

output.h*   Header to include with output routines
output_ex.c* Write data to text files 
output_img.c* Write data to image files
pore.c       Routines for initialising and growing the pores.

pore.h       Header requred by pore.c
pore.w       Cweb source for pore.c

readgeoplus.h* Header, defines default values 
readmat.c*     read ca_matprops.in or specified material file
readmat.h*     header defines default values for mprops
recr_extra.c   extra subroutines for recrystallization eg grain growth rule
